# easequrban
'Easequrban' is my 'Mobile App Development' Course's project. 

EaseQurban is a mobile application designed to simplify the process of booking sacrificial animals (Qurbani) during Eid-ul-Adha. The platform allows users to browse available animals, add them to a virtual cart, choose delivery days, and optionally include butcher services. The goal is to offer a streamlined, reliable, and digital alternative to the traditional, often chaotic Qurbani booking process.
